Description: RPG-style game in which the player creates a character and chooses a pet, and then - get this -  walks their pet. However, this is no leisure pet-walking game, the player must strategically battle enemies that could attack them on their walk!

## Installation

Download the JAR file titled 'PetWalkingSimulator.jar'. This file can be found in the Pet-Walking-Simulator repository.

## Execution

### Requirements

You will need Java 8 installed in order to run the program from the terminal, as projects created with Processing require this.
If you do not have Java 8 installed, note that you will not be able to run the program from the terminal, but you are still able to run it with a default Jar Launcher application (i.e. you'll be able to run it by double clicking the downloaded JAR file).

### Terminal Commands (ONLY WITH JAVA 8)

1. Go to directory in which JAR file has been saved

2. Type:
'''bash
java -jar PetWalkingSimulator.jar
'''
# Pet-Walking-Simulator
